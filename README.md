# Alena's Album

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Hello, my name is Alena and I would like do describe my first Project called Alena's album.

 The home page is a HTML file with styles defined by using internal CSS plus bootstrap columns for the overlapping layout. Also I have applied #id selector, attribute, child and pseudo-element selector in the stylesheet.
 
Next page named "Picturesque and historical places" has been created by combining HTML and external CSS files.
 It is a responsive web page and to make rows and columns looking good on small screens I have used media queries. Also it was convenient for me to show the information on the web page by working with different types of CSS properties and selectors AND a SCSS @extend directive.
 
 "Interesting facts" new-3.html file has been supported by both classic CSS and SCSS nesting stylesheet plus also Bootstrap buttons with badges inside them. Beside that I have tried to create this page with semantic elements and navigation buttons inside the Header as an unordered list. Also i have created a box and styled it with resize property.
 
My next page is New-5.html file named "Delicious food" which has been styled by using  SCSS variable and CSS file  plus  Multiple element selectors and different properties. Inside the Html file I've created a table with links to the approppriate sites.
I was very interested in submitting my last page "Places to relax" wich is column.html file styled with column.css file  by using Bootstrap grid sistem and different grid classes in it, also by nesting one inside another. To make my page more colorful i have created an image gallery with CSS file.

All my pages are decorated with pictures and almost in every page i have used .class selector.
You can very easy navigate from one page of my site to another and enjoy while exploring.
